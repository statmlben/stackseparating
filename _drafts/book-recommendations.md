#The Theory That Would Not Die by Sharon Bertsch Mcgrayne 

hier sagen: coole History insbesondere schön auch mal die Persönlichkeiten der Statistik bekannten Namen zu sehen: Fisher, Neyman, Pearson. Dann auch zweite Weltkrieg, Krypto und Alan Turing. Aber die Mathematik hinter Bayes Theorem wird relativ unbefriedigend erklärt und es bleibt immer die Aura von Zauberei (wie Gandalf dessen Magie nie erklärt wird). After some time the book becomes a bit formulaic: some problem is solved by waving Bayes Theorem like a magical wand. It would have been nice to go into more details from time to time on *how* the theorem helped, but the book stays very surface level on the mathematical details. This was obviously a conscious decision, but leaves me unsatisfied with that aspect of the book. Then again, probability theory is the subject I know most about, compared to the other two books, so maybe I am being biased. However, the characters and the historical accounts are compelling and interesting enough to keep me very engaged in the book.
